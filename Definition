**Authentication** is the act of proving that we are who we say we are.Authentication comes down to three things:
- Something you know : login ID and password
- Something you have : smart card or soft token
- Something you are : fingerprint or other biometrics

**Authorization** is the granting users appropriate access to resources - such as file shares,databases,applications and mailboxes - once they have authenticated themselves.In short,the concept of authorization is simply one of proving you have permission to do something.
